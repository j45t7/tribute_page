        <h2>Who Was Jean-Michel Basquiat?</h2>
        <p>Jean-Michel Basquiat was born on December 22, 1960, in Brooklyn, New York.
          He first attracted attention for his graffiti under the name "SAMO" in New York City.
          He sold sweatshirts and postcards featuring his artwork on the streets before his painting career took off.
          He collaborated with Andy Warhol in the mid-1980s, which resulted in a show of their work. Basquiat died on August 12,
          1988, in New York City. He was 27 years old.</p>

      <div class="facts">
        <h2>About him:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It was his graffiti tag “SAMO” (shorthand for “same old shit”) that first drew public attention. Basquiat created “SAMO” with his friend Al Diaz while the pair were in high school and the tag,which often featured the copyright symbol,
            cropped up on buildings throughout lower Manhattan and Brooklyn between 1977 and 1980. "It was supposed to be a logo, like Pepsi.” Basquiat later told writer Anthony Haden-Guest. The end of the collaboration was announced in 1980 through
            a slue of tags declaring, “SAMO is dead.”</li>
          <li>In his earlier works, Basquiat was known for using a crown motif,
            which was his way of celebrating black people as majestic royalty or deeming them as saints.
            Describing the crown itself in further detail, artist Francesco Clemente posited:
            "Jean-Michel’s crown has three peaks, for his three royal lineages: the poet, the musician,
            the great boxing champion.
            Jean measured his skill against all he deemed strong, without prejudice as to their taste or age." </li>
          <li>He met his lifelong friend and mentor Andy Warhol in 1981 at late-night hotspot Mr. Chow's.
            Swiss dealer Bruno Bischofberger later suggested the two collaborate on a series of paintings,
            and between 1983 and 1985 the pair made works that layered Basquiat’s virtuosic graffiti scrawl over Warhol’s bright Pop imagery.</li>
          <li>Basquiat died of an accidental drug overdose on August 12, 1988, at his Great Jones Street studio. He was 27 years old. In the months preceding his death, the troubled artist claimed to be using a hundred bags of heroin a day. Curator
            and gallerist Jeffrey Deitch delivered a eulogy during his burial at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</li>
          <li>"I'm not a real person. I'm a legend,” Basquiat once claimed. His name and unique personal style have become frequent reference points in popular culture. Fellow Brooklyn-native Jay-Z, for instance, famously paralleled himself to the
            artist in his 2013 song"Picasso Baby," saying ”It ain’t hard to tell, I’m the new Jean-Michel.”</li>
        </ul>
